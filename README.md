# Front-end dashboard

The main function of this dashboard is displaying core informations about development process.

[For example]:
- current branches(versions etc)
- The number of fixed /new bugs
- The number of issues in progress
- Agile process: is it code freeze now or demo today
- Some timeline widget, which will display last actions related to FE,
for example: smb approved PR, made comment/review etc
